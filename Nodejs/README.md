# Authentication
Setting up the authentication flow: This includes defining the
authentication methods (e.g. username and password, OAuth, JWT),
and the authentication process (e.g. sign up, sign in, password reset).
⇒
Storing user information: You'll need to create a database or storage
system to store user information, such as passwords, usernames,
email addresses, and any other relevant data.
⇒
Hashing and salting passwords: To ensure the security of user data, it
is important to hash and salt passwords before storing them in the
database.
⇒
Implementing authentication middleware: This involves creating a
middleware function that checks if the user is authenticated before
they can access certain parts of the application.
Managing authentication tokens: You'll need to manage authentication
tokens to keep track of the user's session. This can be done using
JSON Web Tokens.
